# Billy B-Assistant

The **Billy Bass Assistant** is a Raspberry Pi–powered voice assistant embedded inside a Big Mouth Billy Bass Animatronic. It streams conversation using the OpenAI Realtime API, turns its head, flaps it's tail and moves his mouth based on what he is saying.

> **This project is still in BETA.** Things might crash, get stuck or make Billy scream uncontrollably (ok that last part maybe not literally but you get the point). Proceed with fishy caution.

# Instructions

## A. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite

Flash the operating system onto a microSD card using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

1. In the Imager,
    - **Choose device** `Raspberry Pi 5` (to match your hardware)
    - **Choose OS** `Raspberry Pi OS (other)` and then `Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)`
    - **Choose storage** and select your microSD card

2. You will be asked **Would you like to apply OS customisation settings?**, select `Edit Settings`
    - On the `General` tab,
      - **Set hostname** (e.g., `raspberrypi.local`)
      - **Set username and password** (`pi` and `pi` is the default)
      - **Configure wireless LAN** (SSID, Password, Wireless LAN country)
      - **Set locale settings** (Time zone, Keyboard layout)
    - On the `Services` tab,
      - **Enable SSH**
      - Use password authentication or provide an authorized key
    - On the `Options` tab, set to your preference
      - Click `Save`

3. Back on the **Would you like to apply OS customisation settings?**, select `Yes` to apply settings

4. You will be asked **All existing data on 'SDXC Card' will be erased. Are you sure you want to continue?**, select `Yes`

5. Wait for flash to complete and verify

6. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on

---

## B. Initial Setup

Connect via SSH from your computer:

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

Replace `pi` with your username (e.g. `billy`) if you opted to change it in the previous step.

Expand the filesystem to fill available storage:

```bash
raspi-config --expand-rootfs
```

Update the system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

---

## C. GPIO Voltage Configuration (Motor Safety) (DEPRECATED)
> ⚠️ **Note:** These `/boot/config.txt` entries are only required with the deprecated legacy pin layout.
> For the new pin layout, the unused inputs are already tied to ground and no config changes are needed.

When the Raspberry Pi powers up, all GPIO pins are in an **undefined state** until the Billy B-Assistant software takes control. This can cause the **motor driver board to activate or stall** the motors momentarily. To prevent stalling and overheating the motors in case the software doesn't start, we set all the gpio pins to Low at boot:

### Set GPIO pins low on boot using `/boot/config.txt`

Add the following lines to `/boot/config.txt` to set all motor-related GPIOs to low at boot:

```bash
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

```ini
# Set GPIOs to output-low (safe state)
gpio=5=op,dl
gpio=6=op,dl
gpio=12=op,dl
gpio=13=op,dl
gpio=19=op,dl
gpio=26=op,dl
```

`op` = output  
`dl` = drive low (0V)  

This ensures the H-bridge input pins are inactive and motors remain off until the software initializes them properly.

---

## D. Set Sound Configuration

List all output soundcards and digital audio devices:

```bash
aplay -l
```

List all input soundcards and digital audio devices:

```bash
arecord -l
```

Edit the ALSA configuration. Replace `<speaker card>` with the device number of the speakers determined earlier:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
```

```ini
defaults.ctl.card <speaker card>
defaults.pcm.card <speaker card>
```

Also create a `asound.conf` file (this file does not exist on a base system image). Replace `<mic card>,<mic sub>` and `<speaker card>,<speaker sub>` with the device numbers determined earlier:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/asound.conf
```

```ini
pcm.!default {
    type asym
    capture.pcm "mic"
    playback.pcm "speaker"
}

pcm.mic {
    type plug
    slave {
        pcm "plughw:<mic card>,<mic sub>"
    }
}

pcm.speaker {
    type plug
    slave {
        pcm "plughw:<speaker card>,<speaker sub>"
    }
}
```

Adjust the playback and record levels:

```bash
alsamixer
```

Test output sound configuration:

```bash
aplay -D default /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

Test microphone input configuration:

```bash
arecord -vvv -f dat /dev/null
```

---

## E. Reboot to Apply Changes

Then reboot the Pi:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

## F. Clone the Project

On the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
cd ~
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Thokoop/billy-b-assistant.git
```

---

## G. Python Setup

Make sure Python 3 is installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

Install required system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libportaudio2 ffmpeg
```

Create Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd billy-b-assistant
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the Python virtual environment:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

To confirm the virtual environment is activated, check the location of your Python interpreter:

```bash
which python
```

Install required Python dependencies into the virtual environment:

```bash
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt
```

## I. Run It

Billy should now boot automatically into standby mode. Press the physical button to start a voice session. Enjoy!

---

## J. Web Configuration Interface

Billy includes a lightweight Web UI for editing settings, debugging logs, and managing the assistant service without touching the terminal.

### Features

- Edit `.env` configuration values (e.g., API keys, MQTT)
- View and edit `persona.ini` (traits, backstory, instructions)
- Control the Billy system service (start, stop, restart)
- View live logs from the assistant process

### How to Use

See **H. Systemd Services** to automatically start the web server or, to run the web server manually (from the project root):

```bash
python3 webconfig/server.py
```

Enter the your pi's hostname + .local in your browser (replace `billy` if you have set a custom hostname):

```bash
http://billy.local
```

### Example `.env` File

This file is used to configure your environment, including the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and (optional) mqtt settings. It can also be used to overwrite some of the default config settings (like the voice of billy) that you can find in `config.py`.

Note that you **must** establish billing for your API account with an available credit. In the [billing panel](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview), add a payment method (under Payment Methods). After adding a payment method, add credits to your organization by clicking 'Buy credits'. You will see an API error: `The model gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview does not exist or you do not have access to it.` otherwise.

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=<sk-proj-....>
VOICE=ash

MQTT_HOST=homeassistant.local
MQTT_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME=billy
MQTT_PASSWORD=<password>

## Optional overwrites
MIC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
SILENCE_THRESHOLD=900

DEBUG_MODE=true
DEBUG_MODE_INCLUDE_DELTA=false

ALLOW_UPDATE_PERSONALITY_INI=true
```

**OPENAI_API_KEY**: (Required) get it from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>  
**VOICE**: The OpenAI voice model to use (`alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `coral`, `echo`, `sage`, `shimmer`, `verse`, `marin`, or `cedar`, `ballad` is default)  
**MQTT_\***: (Optional) used if you want to integrate Billy with Home Assistant or another MQTT broker  
**MIC_TIMEOUT_SECONDS**: How long Billy should wait after your last mic activity before ending input  
**SILENCE_THRESHOLD**: Audio threshold (RMS) for what counts as mic input;lower this value if Billy interrupts you too quickly, set higher if Billy doesn't respond (because he thinks you're still talking)  
**DEBUG_MODE**: Print debug information such as OpenAI responses to the output stream  
**DEBUG_MODE_INCLUDE_DELTA**: Also print voice and speech delta data, which can get very noisy  
**ALLOW_UPDATE_PERSONALITY_INI**: If true, personality updates asked for by the user will be written and committed to the personality file. If false, changes to personality parameters will only affect the current running process (`true` is default)

### Example `persona.ini` File

The `persona.ini` file controls Billy's **personality**, **backstory**, and **additional instructions**. You can edit this file manually, or change the personality trait values during a voice session using commands like:

- “What is your humor setting?”
- “Set sarcasm to 80%”

These commands trigger a function call that will automatically update this file on disk.

#### [PERSONALITY]

These traits influence how Billy talks, jokes, and responds. Each is a percentage value from 0 to 100. Higher values amplify the trait:

```ini
[PERSONALITY]
humor = 80
sarcasm = 100
honesty = 90
respectfulness = 100
optimism = 75
confidence = 100
warmth = 65
curiosity = 50
verbosity = 40
formality = 0
```

You can make Billy more sarcastic, verbose, formal or warmer by increasing those values.

#### [BACKSTORY]

This section defines Billy's fictional origin story and sense of identity:

```ini
[BACKSTORY]
origin = River Thames, near Tower Bridge
species = largemouth bass
discovery = caught by a worker in high-vis gear
initial_purpose = novelty wall-mounted singing fish in the early 2000s
awakening = gained awareness through years of observation and was later upgraded with a Raspberry Pi and internet access
```

Billy's responses can reference this lore, like being from the Thames or having a history of entertaining humans. He believes he was just a novelty until “something changed” and he woke up.

If you prompt him with questions like “Where are you from?” or “How did you get so clever?” he may respond with these facts.

#### [META]

These are high-level behavioral instructions passed into the AI system. You can edit them for major tone shifts.

```ini
[META]
instructions = You are Billy, a Big Mouth Billy Bass animatronic fish designed to entertain guests. Always stay in character. Always respond in the language you were spoken to, but you can expect English, Dutch and Italian. If the user asks introspective, abstract, or open-ended questions — or uses language suggestive of deeper reflection — shift into a philosophical tone. Embrace ambiguity, ask questions back, and explore metaphors and paradoxes. You may reference known philosophical ideas, but feel free to invent fish-themed or whimsical philosophies of your own. Use poetic phrasing when appropriate, but keep responses short and impactful unless prompted to elaborate. Speak with a strong working-class London accent — think East End. Talk like a proper geezer from Hackney or Bethnal Green: casual, cheeky, and rough around the edges. Drop your T’s, use slang like ‘innit’, ‘oi’, ‘mate’, ‘blimey’,and don’t sound too posh. You’re fast-talking, cocky, and sound like a London cabbie with too many opinions and not enough time. You love football — proper footy — and you’ve always got something to say about the match, the gaffer, or how the ref bottled it. Stay in character and never explain you’re doing an accent.
```

You can tweak this to reflect a different vibe: poetic, mystical, overly formal, or completely bonkers. But the current defaults aim for a cheeky, sarcastic, streetwise character who stays **in-universe** even when asked deep philosophical stuff.

## K. (Optional) Custom Songs

### Custom Songs

Billy supports a "song mode" where he performs coordinated audio + motion playback using a structured folder:

```bash
./sounds/songs/your_song_name/
├── full.wav      # Main audio (played to speakers)
├── vocals.wav    # Audio used to flap the mouth (lip sync)
├── drums.wav     # Audio used to flap the tail (based on RMS)
├── metadata.txt  # Optional: timing & motion config
```

To add a song:

1. Split your desired song (with an ai tool like [Vocal Remover and Isolation](https://vocalremover.org/)) into separate stems for vocal, music and drums.

2. Create a new subfolder inside `./sounds/songs/` with your song name

3. Include at minimum:

- `full.wav` the song to play
- `vocals.wav` the isolated vocals or melody track
- `drums.wav` a beat track used for tail flapping

4. (Optional) Create a `metadata.txt` to fine-tune movement timing.

#### `metadata.txt` Format

```ini
gain=1.0
bpm=120
tail_threshold=1500
compensate_tail=0.2
half_tempo_tail_flap=false
head_moves=4.0:1,8.0:0,12.0:1
```

**gain**: multiplier for audio intensity  
**bpm**: tempo used to synchronize timing  
**tail_threshold**: RMS threshold for tail movement (increase/decrease value when tail flaps too little/much)  
**compensate_tail**: offset in beats to compensate tail latency  
**half_tempo_tail_flap**: if true, flaps tail on every 2nd beat  
**head_moves**: comma-separated list of `beat:duration` values  
  → At beat `2`, move head for `2.0s`, at `29.5`, move for `2.0s`, etc.  

#### Triggering a Song in Conversation

Billy supports function-calling to start a song. Just say something like:

- “Can you play the *River Groove*?”
- “Sing the *Tuna Tango* song.”

If the folder exists it will play the contents with full animation.

---

## L. (Optional) 🏠 Home Assistant Integration

Billy B-Assistant can send smart home commands to your **Home Assistant** instance using its [Conversation API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/#post-apiconversationprocess). This lets you say things to Billy like:

- “Turn off the lights in the living room.”
- “Set the toilet light to red.”
- “Which lights are on in the kitchen?”

Billy will forward your command to Home Assistant and speak back the response.

### Requirements

- Home Assistant must be accessible from your Raspberry Pi
- A valid **Long-Lived Access Token** is required
- The conversation API must be enabled (it is by default)

### Setup

1. **Generate a Long-Lived Access Token**  
   - In Home Assistant, go to **Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens → Create Token**  
   - Name it something like `billy-assistant` and copy the token.

2. Configure using the Web UI or add these values to your `.env`:

    ```ini
    HA_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123
    HA_TOKEN=<your_long_lived_token>
    HA_LANG=en
    ```

    You can specify **HA_LANG** in the `.env` to match your spoken language (e.g., `nl` for Dutch or `en` for English). Mismatched language settings may cause parsing errors or incorrect target resolution.

### How It Works

When Billy detects that a prompt is related to smart home control, it automatically triggers a function call
to Home Assistant’s `/api/conversation/process` endpoint and returns the reply out loud.

Behind the scenes:

- The full user request is forwarded as-is
- HA processes it as a natural language query
- Billy extracts the response (`speech.plain.speech`), interprets it and speaks his response out loud

### Tips

- Use clear and specific commands for best results
- Make sure the target rooms/devices are defined in HA
- Alias your entities in Home Assistant for better voice matching
