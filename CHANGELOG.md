## [2.0.0] — 2025-11-02
>### 🎉 Major New Features:
> **User Profiles with memories - Multiple Personas - Custom Song Manager**

### Added

- **User Profiles**: Billy now identifies users when they introduce themselves (e.g., "Hi Billy, it's Thom")
  - Create/switch profiles, set display names, guest mode
  - Import/export profiles
  - Profile-specific statistics like interaction count and last seen timestamps
- **Memory System**: Billy remembers facts, preferences, and relationships for each user
  - Categorize by type (fact, preference, relationship, event, other)
  - Set importance levels (low, medium, high)
  - Edit/delete memories through UI
- **Multiple Personas**: Create and switch between different Billy personalities
  - Voices and mouth articulation per persona
  - Configurable personality traits (humor, sarcasm, honesty, etc.)
  - Import/export personas
  - Mid-conversation persona switching with graceful voice changes
  - Persona presets/templates for quick setup
- **Custom Song Manager**: Web UI for managing custom songs
  - Upload custom audio files (full.wav, vocals.wav, drums.wav)
  - Configure playback & animation settings (gain, tail threshold, compensate tail, head moves, half tempo tail flap)
  - Set song title and keywords for AI-triggered playback
  - Preview audio files before saving
  - Copy example songs to get started
- **UI Improvements**: 
  - 4-level configurable logging (ERROR/WARNING/INFO/VERBOSE)
  - Loading states and optimized polling

### Changed

- **Persona Storage**: Personas now stored in `./personas/persona_name/persona.ini`. The default persona remains at `./persona.ini` for backward compatibility.
- **Custom Wake-up Sounds**: Wake-up sounds are now saved per persona instead of globally
- **Logging System**: Replaced `DEBUG_MODE` with configurable `LOG_LEVEL` system (ERROR/WARNING/INFO/VERBOSE)
- **Mouth Articulation**: Now configured per persona instead of globally
- **Song Metadata Format**: Updated from `metadata.txt` to `metadata.ini` for consistency
- **Song Directory**: Custom songs now stored in `custom_songs/` (git-ignored) instead of `sounds/songs/` (which still holds the fishsticks song as a template)

### Fixed

- **Self-Triggering**: Billy no longer hears his own wake-up sounds
- **Head Movement**: Prevented head from getting stuck during routines
- **Session Hanging**: Added timeouts to prevent stuck sessions
- **Audio**: Standardized RMS calculations for consistent silence detection

## [1.5.0] — 2025-10-13

>### ⚠️ For existing builds of Billy: ⚠️ 
> 
> **Please select the Legacy Pin Layout in the Hardware Settings tab of the Web UI if you can't switch to the new unified wiring layout (see [BUILDME.md](./docs/BUILDME.md#from-motor-driver-to-raspberry-pi-gpio-pinout))**

### Added
- **Configurable Pin Layouts:** Introduced `BILLY_PINS` Pin Layout setting (`new` / `legacy`) to switch between the new (default) pin layout and the legacy pin layout (for builds before october '25)
- **Mouth Articulation Control:** Added `MOUTH_ARTICULATION` (1–10) setting to fine-tune speech motion responsiveness.
- **Error Sound Handling:**  Centralized error playback — now plays `error.wav`, `noapikey.wav`, or `nowifi.wav` depending on the issue.
- **Release notes notification:** Notification in the UI with the release notes of the latest version.

### Changed
- **Unified GPIO Logic:** Refactored motor control for both Modern (2-motor) and Classic (3-motor) models into a single system. Default pin assignments moved to safer GPIOs. Unused H-bridge inputs are now grounded;
- **Movement Refinements:** Improved PWM handling and non-blocking motion timing for smoother, more natural flapping.
- **UI Enhancements:** Added Billy artwork to header and included reboot/power/restart-ui buttons. Improved feedback for mic and speaker device tests.

### Fixed
- Minor mouth sync inconsistencies under load.
- Occasional stalls caused by blocking PWM threads.
- Better recovery after OpenAI API or network errors.
- Motor watchdog will now disengage any motor that is on > 30 seconds
